Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say, throw cares away.
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer, to young and old, meek and the bold.
Ding dong ding dong, that is their song with joyful ring all caroling.
One seems to hear words of good cheer from everywhere filling the air.
Oh how they pound raising the sound o'er hill and dale telling their tale.
Gaily they ring while people sing songs of good cheer, Christmas is here.
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas.
Merry, Merry, Merry, Merry Christmas.
On, on they send, on without end, their joyful tone to every home.
Ding dong ding dong, ding dong ding dong


Dashing through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh.
O'er the fields we go, laughing all the way.
Bells on bobtail ring, making spirits bright.
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight!
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.
Jingle bells, jingle bells, Jingle all the way.
Oh! what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.


Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer had a very shiny nose.
And if you ever saw it you would even say it glows.
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names.
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games.
Then one foggy Christmas Eve, Santa came to say.
Rudolph with your nose so bright, won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then how all the reindeer loved him as they shouted out with glee.
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, you'll go down in history.
