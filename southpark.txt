This country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has
ever seen, and they knew one thing: that a truly great country could go to
war and at the same time – act like it doesn’t want to. You people who are
for the war: you need the protesters, because they make the country look
like it’s full of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are
anti-war, you need these flag-wavers, because if our whole country was made up
of soft protesters, we’d get taken down in a second. That’s why the founding 
fathers decided we should have both. It’s called having your 
cake and eating it too.

You people focus so hard on the things wrong with Christmas that you've
forgotten what's so right about it. Don't you see? This is the one time of
year we're s'posed to forget all the bad stuff, to stop worrying and being
sad about the state of the world, and for just one day say, ‘Aw, the heck
with it! Let's sing and dance and bake cookies’.

Now children, listen to me. Why do you want to go back in time? Life
isn’t about going back.  It’s about going forward. Yes, there are times in
our lives that we wish we could relive but if we already lived them perfectly,
why live them again? The adventure of life is that there’s always something
new – new challenges, new experiences. A fun game is a game that gets harder
as it goes. So it is with life. Do you understand?

I’m sad, but at the same time I’m really happy that something made me feel
that sad. It’s like, it makes me feel alive, you know? It makes me feel
human. The only way I could feel this sad now is if I felt something really
good before, so I have to take the bad with the good. So I guess what I’m
feeling is like, the beautiful sadness.

Family isn’t about whose blood you have in you. Family’s about the people
who cared about you and took care of you. We’re not the same blood, but I
love my little brother. We’ve taken care of him because he needed us to, and
that makes us more family than anything.
